## Work Experience
**Urban Water Engineer @ Ingenieurb√ºro K. Langenbach Dresden (_February 2022 - September 2023_)**
- Designed and implemented effective urban drainage systems to manage stormwater.
- Designed and implemented road infrastructure projects.
- Collaborated with multidisciplinary teams to the design and construction of flood control structures, for vulnerable settlements.

**Urban Water Researcher/Intern @ Institute for Urban Water Management (_October 2020 - February 2022_)**
- Developed a sediment transport model using EPA SWMM and R to enhance stormwater quality models for urban land covers.
- Demonstrated programming proficiency in R to calibrate and validate sediment transport models, contributing to the identification of high sediment load areas and proposing pollution mitigation alternatives in urban water systems.

## Projects
### Lending Club Dataset

- Conducted end-to-end data science project, from dataset exploration and statistical analysis to developing and deploying machine learning models for automated lending decisions.
- Achieved a high classification accuracy of 93% for rejected and 99% for accepted loan applications, deploying the best-performing model (Decision Tree).

### European Football Database
[Repository Link](https://github.com/renatomarianoo/European-Football-Database)
- Conducted in-depth exploration of the European Soccer Database, identifying key trends in goal-scoring, top scorers, and home advantage across leagues and countries.
- Developed and compared machine learning models, with the RandomForestClassifier excelling in predicting match winners and Multinomial Logistic Regression achieving superior accuracy in goal prediction.
- Generated valuable insights into player attributes, league-specific dynamics, and suggested future improvements for enhanced model performance in European football predictions.

### COVID-19 South Korea Dataset Analysis
[Repository Link](https://github.com/renatomarianoo/COVID-19-South-Korea)
- Analyzed a Kaggle dataset on Coronavirus cases in South Korea, showcasing key insights such as the exponential growth in cases, positive impact of social policies, and age/gender susceptibility.
- Highlighted the geographical impact, identifying Daegu as an epicenter, and revealed the absence of correlation between cases and population.
- Emphasized the increasing mortality rate with age, reaching 25% in the 80s age group, providing crucial insights for understanding the impact of COVID-19.

### Red Wine Quality Dataset
[Repository Link](https://github.com/renatomarianoo/Wine-Quality-Dataset)
- Conducted analysis on a red wine quality dataset, focusing on physiochemical features and excluding sensitive information like grape types and selling prices.
- Developed models predicting wine quality and alcohol level, achieving 82% accuracy in quality prediction and identifying high alcohol levels as a crucial parameter for good wine quality.
- Addressed challenges in predicting extreme wine categories, provided insights for potential model improvements, and performed statistical inference analysis to identify key factors influencing wine quality.
