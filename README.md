## Work Experience
**Urban Water Engineer @ Ingenieurbüro K. Langenbach Dresden (_February 2022 - September 2023_)**
- Designed and implemented effective urban drainage systems to manage stormwater.
- Designed and implemented road infrastructure projects.
- Collaborated with multidisciplinary teams to the design and construction of flood control structures, for vulnerable settlements.

**Urban Water Researcher/Intern @ Institute for Urban Water Management (_October 2020 - February 2022_)**
- Developed a sediment transport model using EPA SWMM and R to enhance stormwater quality models for urban land covers.
- Demonstrated programming proficiency in R to calibrate and validate sediment transport models, contributing to the identification of high sediment load areas and proposing pollution mitigation alternatives in urban water systems.

## Projects

### [Risk Evaluation Retail Banks](https://github.com/renatomarianoo/Risk_Evaluation_Retail_Banks)
- Led an end-to-end data science project, from dataset exploration and statistical analysis to developing and deploying machine learning models for automated decisions for the Home Credit Bank.
- Identified pivotal features for credit approval.
- Implemented a model resulting in a 4.7% reduction in defaulted credits, equating to a potential financial risk mitigation of $2.6 billion.

### [European Football Database](https://github.com/renatomarianoo/European-Football-Database)
- Led a thorough exploration of the European Soccer Database, uncovering key trends in goal-scoring, top scorers, and home advantage across diverse leagues and countries. 
- Conducted a meticulous comparison of machine learning models, with the RandomForestClassifier excelling in predicting match winners.
- Proposed forward-looking enhancements for optimized model performance.

### [COVID-19 South Korea Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/renatomarianoo/COVID-19-South-Korea)
- Analyzed a Kaggle dataset on Coronavirus cases in South Korea, showcasing key insights such as the exponential growth in cases, positive impact of social policies, and age/gender susceptibility.
- Highlighted the geographical impact, identifying Daegu as an epicenter, and revealed the absence of correlation between cases and population.
- Emphasized the increasing mortality rate with age, reaching 25% in the 80s age group, providing crucial insights for understanding the impact of COVID-19.

### [Red Wine Quality Dataset](https://github.com/renatomarianoo/Wine-Quality-Dataset)
- Delved into the Coronavirus cases in South Korea, unveiling crucial insights such as the exponential growth in cases, the positive impact of social policies, and nuanced age/gender susceptibility patterns. 
- Illuminated the geographical impact, pinpointing Daegu as an epicenter, and revealed a lack of correlation between cases and population density. 
- Emphasized the escalating mortality rate with age, particularly reaching 25% in the 80s age group, providing crucial insights for understanding the impact of COVID-19.
